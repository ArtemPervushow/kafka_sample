Spongecell Backend Interview Assignment

As part of your interview, please complete the assignment described below before or shortly after your scheduled
interview. It will be graded primarily on functionality and cleanliness.

Split the project into two sub-modules: one which saves the record, and another which provides the REST API. Use Kafka
to transport the records, and use MessagePack as the serialization format.
